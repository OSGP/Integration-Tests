Feature: MicroGrids Get PhotoVoltaic System Data
  In order to be able to know data of a photovoltaic system with a remote terminal unit
  As an OSGP client
  I want to get PV data from an RTU

  Scenario: Request PV1 Health
    Given an rtu iec61850 device
      | DeviceIdentification | RTU10001 |
    And an rtu simulator returning
      | PV1 | LLN0.Health.stVal |        3 |
      | PV1 | LLN0.Health.q     | OLD_DATA |
    When a get data request is received
      | DeviceIdentification      | RTU10001 |
      | NumberOfSystems           |        1 |

      | NumberOfMeasurements_1    |        1 |
      | MeasurementFilterNode_1_1 | Health   |
    Then the get data response should be returned
      | DeviceIdentification     | RTU10001 |
      | Result                   | OK       |
